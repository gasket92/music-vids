            <p class="comment">Pop-punk. Kinda similar to City Lights from the first website!</p>

            <p class="comment">The Wonder Years started as an easycore band but the singer is pretty much ashamed of their old music and that style. They've turned into rock/pop band with very depressing lyrics but they're one of my favourite bands at the moment. This song is somewhere during the transition. They are fantastic though. Listen to all their stuff one day haha</p>

            <p class="comment">This band started off easycore, this whole EP is fantastic but just check out the first song. They slowly changed direction to more like pop rock (and were still very good) but are now basically a pop duo (no original members and I don't like haha).</p>

            <p class="comment">Possibly the best easycore album there is. Great breakdown from 2:00-2:30</p>

            <p class="comment">Easycore but weird! These guys are so highly regarded for being super unique. They're bizarre but fantastic. I hope you like but it's certainly Marmite-y (love or hate!). I love. Definitely a good one for broadening musical horizons. Breakdown at 3:30 is superb. We are heeerrreeeeeeee!</p>

            <p class="comment">Metalcore/Post-Hardcore. Attack Attack got a lot of hate but I thought this album was great. The term crabcore came about from this video pretty much because they're all standing like crabs.</p>

            <p class="comment">Female clean singer, male screaming. Not sure what genre you'd put this in but it's sort of pop-metal/power metal/metalcore. Lots of synthesiser. Very catchy!</p>
