            <p class="comment">The Wonder Years started as an easycore band but the singer is pretty much ashamed of their old music and that style. They've turned into rock/pop band with very depressing lyrics but they're one of my favourite bands at the moment. This song is somewhere during the transition. They are fantastic though. Listen to all their stuff one day haha</p>

            <p class="comment">This band started off easycore, this whole EP is fantastic but just check out the first song. They slowly changed direction to more like pop rock (and were still very good) but are now basically a pop duo (no original members and I don't like haha).</p>

            <p class="comment">Possibly the best easycore album there is. Great breakdown from 2:00-2:30</p>

            <p class="comment">Easycore but weird! These guys are so highly regarded for being super unique. They're bizarre but fantastic. I hope you like but it's certainly Marmite-y (love or hate!). I love. Definitely a good one for broadening musical horizons. Breakdown at 3:30 is superb. We are heeerrreeeeeeee!</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDzt6yI3Dw8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">Metalcore/Post-Hardcore. Attack Attack got a lot of hate but I thought this album was great. The term crabcore came about from this video pretty much because they're all standing like crabs.</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2e_3ZnJcTE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">Female clean singer, male screaming. Not sure what genre you'd put this in but it's sort of pop-metal/power metal/metalcore. Lots of synthesiser. Very catchy!</p>

            <p class="comment">This dude has a pretty unusual voice. Drumming at 02:50 I used to have on repeat!</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_ICd7_307w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">Very solid song and this album is a metalcore classic. Good blend of clean and harsh vocals.</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9-Wc_jZqfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">Hardcore Metal. I don't really like this genre too much because I don't like the singing. It's more shouting than screaming. There are only one or two bands that I would call Hardcore that I do like, and these aren't one of them but you should have a check.</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JBqKV4eQpUk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">The harsh vocals are a bit hardcorey but I do love this song. The section at 1:50 is worthy of goosebumps and the overlapping vocalists at the end 'we sing out of sync' is so good.</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTRlPPhTGEk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">My favourite album when I was around your age. They're still a band and actually put out an album a few weeks ago which is surprisingly good!</p>

            <p class="comment">Thrash/Melodic Death Metal. One of my favourite outro riffs. That last minute is delicious</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7sSOUSxmG4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">Thrash/Melodic Death Metal. Their solos are amazing. I didn't like these guys when I first heard them but they eventually became one of my favourite bands despite the vocals which I found a bit boring.</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mY_7N9SXVOo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">Probably metalcore still but quite different. These guys have a very distinctive sound. Don't think you'll necessarily like this but worth a listen and the drums are cool. Another one of the best outros in metal.</p>
