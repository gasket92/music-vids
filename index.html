        <h2>Genre: Pop Punk</h2>
        <p>Pop punk is a rock music genre that combines punk rock with pop and power pop. It's known for its fast pace, energetic sound, and relatable lyrics. Not really metal but worth a mention.</p>
        <div class="video">
            <h3>City Lights - Hang Out</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIX0kER8G_8?si=4t3qUqXwAvFpB9tl" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">I was a big fan of these guys back in the day.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Genre: Easycore</h2>
        <p>Easycore is essentially pop punk that incorporates elements of metalcore, such as breakdowns (I live for breakdowns, I'll point those out) and screaming vocals, while maintaining a catchy and melodic sound.</p>
        <div class="video">
            <h3>Abandoned By Bears - Heads or Tails</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCDXvmQzi-A?si=LQlagGDbO_CazElF5" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">The breakdown from 02:40 til the end is a good example.</p>

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CN4IIgFz93k?si=TY0qVxos8REq0ugV" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">A Day to Remember are one of the most famous and popular bands that do this sort of music but over their career their style has changed a bit.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Genre: Post-Hardcore</h2>
        <p>Lots of melody and harmony, usually high-pitched singing but with sections that are aggressive with screaming.</p>
        <div class="video">

            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3McKCJ_O198?si=nP1pKVm0zyKo_4-d" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">This was my favourite song for a long time. Parkway Drive were my favourite band in my late teens. They're actually massive now. Breakdown at 02:55.</p>

        <h2>Genre: Deathcore</h2>
        <p>Deathcore combines death metal with metalcore. The vocalist is often what sets a band apart in this genre. It's a competition to see who can make the most gnarly, horrible sounds. Almost never any clean singing.</p>
        <div class="video">
            <h3>Signs of the Swarm - Nightcrawler</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2BDZYH0MQ4?si=JjtpQvAD4-iBTRL6" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p class="comment">These guys are a modern band doing Deathcore like it used to be in the 00s (the glory days).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Genre: Slam</h2>
        <p>Slam death metal is a subgenre of death metal known for its heavy, low-tuned sound and intense breakdowns. Vocals are usually just gurgly noises, quite one-dimensional in a way.</p>
        <div class="video">
            <h3>Desoectomy - Dumptruck Disembodiment</h3>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kop7jd2oz_s?si=noNd-on4MYbvEnpn" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="comment">That riff at 0:47 is basically all slam songs ever. Iconic.</p>
